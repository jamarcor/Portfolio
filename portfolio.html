        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I'm James and I've been in San Francisco and the Bay Area for all of my adult life and love the area.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
          <p> Had my roots working in public libraries which formed in me an interest in structure and order. Although the last five years or so I had been working in bartending/service industry which definitely instilled the ability to work under stress! Although those two disparate fields might not exactly sound like they lead to coding, I'm grateful for my unique perspective and am greatly looking forward to challening myself and working hard. Being a general geek and information hog definitely helps.</p>

          <li>Video/Board games. I sense this is a common interest amongst aspiring coders.</li>

          <li>Cooking has been my newfound love. </li>
