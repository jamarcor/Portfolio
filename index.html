            I'm James and I've been in San Francisco and the Bay Area for all of my adult life and love the area.

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>My work history prior to moving to San Francisco was all in libraries. My love of books got me there but it gave me an appreciation for order and technology. After moving here I began a career in the service industry. Working as a server and bartender gave me a great sense of camraderie. Working as a bartender can be incredibly stressful, but with the right team, you can get through the roughest of shifts. These jobs may sound disparate, but I think they gave me the tools needed to be a successful coder.</p>
           <hr /> <-- added anotheer hr element to hopefully satisfy the requirement. I was under the impression the places I had them before were well placed but I might've needed it between paragraphs -->
          <p>Although I've only started to dip my toes into coding, I've been having a blast doing it. I've always had a curiosity for the field, probably thanks to the nerdier aspects of my interests like books, puzzles and of course video games, but I now have the time(for better or worse) to buckle down and start learning. Talking with my mentor and exploring these new lessons have been such fun. I know some tough times are up ahead but I can't wait to tackle them with some like-minded learners. </p>
